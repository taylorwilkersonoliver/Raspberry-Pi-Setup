# Raspberry-Pi-Setup
This repository is just a small collection of various commands I keep around for setting up a few things on my Raspberry Pi's.
I'll update this as I get time with:
1.  LCD screen manufacturer links and setup information.
2.  Tutorial for setting up the LCD.
3.  Pictures.
4.  Necessary specifics for use with Raspberry Pi Zero W and Raspberry Pi 3B+.
